## üå∑ Concept:
Intead of displaying time in traditional numerals, it uses natural growth as a time indicator. Each month consisting of 12 flower frames, 3 per week. Watch your main birth flower bloom alongside its secondary flowers to represent the passage of weeks. From a simple pot to full glory, every 2-3 days a new frame appears.
